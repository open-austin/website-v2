          All Open Austin events and their staff, presenters, and participants
          are held to an anti-harassment policy, included below.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          In addition to governing our own events by this policy, Open Austin
          will only lend our name and fund groups that offer an anti-harassment
          policy to their attendees. For information on how to offer an
          anti-harassment policy to your group, see&nbsp;

          Open Austin is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
          everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
          orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
          nationality, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of staff,
          presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery
          is not appropriate for any Open Austin event or network activity,
          including talks. Anyone in violation of these policies may be expelled
          from Open Austin events or network activities, at the discretion of
          the event organizers.

          Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written
          comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
          orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
          religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation;
          stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained
          disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact;
          unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing
          language or action.

          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers
          may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the
          offender or expulsion from Open Austin events and network activities.

          Our leadership and event staff will help participants contact venue
          security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise
          assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of
          the event.&nbsp; If you cannot reach an event organizer and/or it is
          an emergency, please call 911 and/or remove yourself from the
          situation.
